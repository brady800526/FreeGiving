# FreeGiving
> FreeGiving is an easy-use trading platform, mainly based on map to achieve user-to-user interaction. This App hopes to conveniently and precisely deliver the product detail to others. It could largely reduce the complexity compared to searching items on PTT freegiving board just by posting the item on the map with name, address and photo. Then the giver can chat with user, who is interested in your item, and know the item status immediately.
